SAP HCM Dynamic Actions

This is a simple report which can edit the SAP HCM dynamic actions in a better UI. You've got a better overview with the tree control on the left side. You can Rebuild the sequenz number, so now if you add new Dynamic Actions, those rows will get a sequenz number and you don't need to add it. 




## Installation and prerequisite

+ Use ABAPGit to install [Transport-Services](https://github.com/DennstedtB/Transport-Services) first
+ Use ABAPGIT to install this report. 

If you don't want to use the transport services libary for it ( maybe because it isn't finished yet ) then please wait for Release 1.0 where the transport management is done via function modules. From Release 2.0 on the transport services libary is the only one which will be used.
