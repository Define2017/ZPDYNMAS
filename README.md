SAP HCM Dynamic Actions

This is a simple report which can edit the SAP HCM dynamic actions in a better UI. You've got a better overview with the tree control on the left side. You can Rebuild the sequenz number, so now if you add new Dynamic Actions, those rows will get a sequenz number and you don't need to add it. 

The report also writes your changes ( after you saved it ) directly into an transport request.
